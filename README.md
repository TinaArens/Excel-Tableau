## About the Project "Preparing for Influenza Season"
To help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for influenza season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for staffing needs across the country.

### Key Requirements: 

* Provide information to support a staffing plan, detailing what data can help inform the timing and spatial distribution of medical personnel throughout the United States.
* Determine whether influenza occurs seasonally or throughout the entire year. If seasonal, does it start and end at the same time (month) in every state?
* Prioritize states with large vulnerable populations. Consider categorizing each state as low-, medium-, or high-need based on its vulnerable population count.
* Assess data limitations that may prevent you from conducting your desired analyses.

### Tools
Analysis has been conducted in Excel as well as using SQL in pgAdmin - Management Tool for PostgreSQL
